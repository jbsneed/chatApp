# Introduction
--------
ChatApp allows users to send and receive text messages, photos, and locations. 

# Get Started
----

To run, install expo in your project folder:
**npm install expo-cli -g**

Create a Firebase account [here](https://firebase.google.com/). Firebase is used for data storage in the project. Check the firebase [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for more details on how to initalize Cloud Firestore.

Start app by running:
**npm start**

This will launch DevTools on port 19002. You can run the app on a physical device or emulator by scanning the QR code or creating and signing in to an expo account. To run on your device, download and install the expo app from the app store.

For information on how to set up an emulator for testing, visit [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/). Click "Run on Android device/emulator" in the DevTools to launch the app on your emulator.
